# SQL-Business-Question
I work with a modified version of the Chinook database, which contains information about a digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.

I analyse the data to identify key insights:

- popular artists/genres - to select albums to buy
- employee sales performance
- sales by country
- album sales vs individual track sales
